# Supervised Machine Learning Regression Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning algorithms to perform regression analysis. The primary goal is to predict continuous outcomes based on input features. This can be particularly useful in various fields, including real estate pricing, sales forecasting, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of various features relevant to the target variable. For instance, it may include data such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and price (or other continuous variables). The dataset can be sourced from public repositories or generated synthetically for demonstration purposes.

## Algorithms Used
- **Linear Regression**: A fundamental algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.
- **Decision Trees**: A non-linear regression algorithm that splits the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like model of decisions.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: A regression algorithm that uses support vector machines for predicting continuous values.

## Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn** for implementing machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization

## Results
The project includes visualizations of the regression results, model performance metrics (such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R² score), and comparisons between different algorithms.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the power of supervised machine learning in regression tasks and provides insights into selecting appropriate algorithms based on the problem at hand. Users can easily modify the dataset and algorithms used to suit their own needs.
